## Blog Assignment #1: Comparing Articles
*This blog post will talk about what a data scientist is, the major knowledge areas, and how they relate to statisticians.*

I think being a data scientist is all about answering questions or solving problems using data through visualization and statistics.  
The major duties and knowledge areas revolve around statistics, mathematics, coding, and data analytics (modeling, interpretation, and visualization)

Both data scientists and statisticians have a strong coding knowledge, with R or Python almost acting as necessities, but experience with  
other programs as well, like SQL. They also have a firm understanding of statistics, data wrangling, and data visualization. Collecting,  
cleaning, and processing data is also an important skill that both encounter. Data science is a relatively new field, with an emphasis on  
analytical application rather than mathematical theory and concepts.

As you can see, there are many similarities between data scientists and statisticians. I think the starkest difference is the degree a position  
requires. Statistician positions typically look for a statistics/mathematics degree while a data scientist position may be open to a statistics/mathematics,  
computer science, data analytics, or engineering degree. Similarly, pure statistician positions are most often in government or pharmacy. Data  
scientist positions can be found in nearly all industries including finance, sports, and construction.  

I personally view myself as more of a data scientist who is obtaining the skills to become a statistician. I think there are clear overlaps  
between the two, but also some important slight differences. I imagine my career taking me towards a data scientist/analyst role as opposed  
to a pure statistician working in academia, government, or pharmacy.
