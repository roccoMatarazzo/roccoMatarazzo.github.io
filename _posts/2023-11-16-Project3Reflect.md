I enjoyed this project! 

The toughest part of the project, in my opinion, was the EDA section. I feel like there is only so much you can do with categorical data before it begins to get repetitive. 

Something I would have done differently would be running the automated report sooner.

Overall, I enjoyed completing this project and certainly enjoyed choosing our own partner! I've had a couple classes with Karthik through this program and we've gotten to work together a few times. He's a great classmate! Aside from that, GitHub Pages is a super awesome tool that I am looking forward to using in the future. It can display things in a really nice visually pleasing format. I think the best part about it is that it's free!
