## This is my first blog post

This post is exactly what the title indicates -- my first blog post! I have attached two code blocks below for fun.

Here is some example SQL Code:
```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```

Here is some example R Code:
```r
software_names <- c("r", "python", "sql")
 ```
