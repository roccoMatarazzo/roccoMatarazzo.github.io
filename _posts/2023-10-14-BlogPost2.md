## Blog Post Assignment 2: EDA
*This blog post will discuss my personal experience with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  

**For your blog post, write up the strategy you use for EDA.**
**What is your overall goal when doing an EDA?**
**What methods do you think are important?**
**What things do you try to look for?**

I certaintly agree with the prompt that EDA is essentially an art or practice. It definitely takes some getting used to and over time I believe it should get easier, or at least, a little more routine. 

I am not super experienced with EDA. With most of my experience coming from college assignments, along with some minor EDA-related projects at work, I still very much feel like I'm getting the hang of it. However, in each instance my overall goal was to identify patterns or better understand the data at hand before advancing to next steps, like building a model or running a statistical test. It would be quite difficult to build a model or test a hypothesis without understanding the data.

My strategy is probably similar to others. I have almost always used R-Studio for EDA. The very first thing I do is read the data into R and simply look at the data.frame and try to gauge the datatypes that I have. The goal of this is to figure out if any columns could be factorable/represented on a level-basis or if any columns are binary. Knowing this will have an impact on how I plot and visualize my data.
