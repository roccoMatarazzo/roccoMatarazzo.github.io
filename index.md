Welcome! I'm Rocco Matarazzo, a third year Master's in Statistics student at North Carolina State University.

I'm currently employed as a Junior Data Engineer for the Tampa Bay Rays.

The goal of this blog is to explore and utilize GitHub, post about course topics, and code used in the ST558 course.
